2. Project Details
1. Overview
This project implements a simple push-style client-server chat application for a local
network. The system allows multiple clients to connect to a single server, register
unique usernames, and exchange messages in real-time. The server immediately
pushes messages to recipients without requiring periodic polling.
Key Features
• User Registration: Enforces a unique username for each client.
• Real-Time Message Delivery: Messages are “pushed” from the server to the
recipient as soon as they are sent.
• Online User List: Clients can request a list of all currently active users.
• Graceful Exit: Clients can disconnect cleanly, notifying the server so their username
is freed and no longer displayed.
2. Architecture and Components
2.1 Server
• Port Listening
o Listens on a designated port (e.g., 8080) for incoming connections.
• Threaded Connections
o Spawns a new thread for each client connection, allowing concurrent
handling of multiple clients.
• User Management
o Maintains a dictionary (or map) of active username → socket.
o Ensures usernames are unique. If a requested username is taken, the server
rejects it.
• Real-Time Push
o On receiving a message destined for <recipient>, the server immediately
calls recipient_socket.send(...).
• Commands Handling
o Registration: Processes a registration command (e.g., server:register
<username>).
o List Users: Responds to a request for who is online (e.g., server:who).
o Exit: Handles user exit, removing the user’s entry from the dictionary and
closing the socket.
2.2 Client
• Connection
o Connects to the server using the server’s IP/hostname and port.
• Username Prompt
o Requests a username from the user (e.g., Alice) upon startup.
o Sends a registration command to the server to claim that username.
• Two-Thread Model
0. Main Thread: Waits for console input (input()) to parse commands and
send data to the server.
1. Listener Thread: Continuously listens on the socket for incoming messages
and prints them immediately to the user’s console.
• Supported Commands
o <recipient>:<message> – Sends <message> to <recipient>.
o server:who – Requests a list of online users from the server.
o server:exit – Gracefully disconnects from the server, closing the socket
and freeing the username.
3. Detailed Requirements
3.1 User Registration
• Client
o Prompt user for a username at launch.
o Send a registration request to the server (e.g., server:register
<username>).
• Server
o Validates uniqueness of the username.
o If accepted, records <username, socket> in its dictionary.
o If the username is already taken, instructs the client to pick a different name.
3.2 Real-Time (Push) Message Delivery
• Server
o Upon receiving <recipient>:<message> from a client, immediately
locates <recipient> in the dictionary.
o If <recipient> is online, calls recipient_socket.send(...) to push
the message.
o If <recipient> is offline, informs the sender that delivery failed (or queues
the message, if desired).
• Client
o The listener thread prints messages as soon as they arrive, without any
polling logic.
3.3 Online User List
• Client
o Sends server:who to request the current list of active users.
o The listener thread displays the received list.
• Server
o Replies with a formatted list of currently registered usernames.
3.4 Graceful Exit
• Client
o User types server:exit to disconnect.
o Notifies the server of the exit request, then closes the socket.
• Server
o Removes the user from the internal dictionary.
o Alerts other users if necessary (optional).
4. Implementation Details
1. Imports
o Use Python’s built-in libraries: socket, threading, argparse (optional
for command-line arguments).
2. Server Module (e.g., server.py)
o Parse Arguments: --port <port_number> for specifying the listening
port.
o Start Server Socket: server_socket =
socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) then
bind() and listen().
o Connection Loop: In a loop, accept() new client connections and spawn a
thread to handle each client.
o Client Handler: The thread responsible for:
▪ Parsing registration commands (server:register).
▪ Storing/validating usernames.
▪ Handling message forwarding.
▪ Responding to server:who and server:exit.
o Data Structures:
▪ users = {username: client_socket, ...} for active users.
3. Client Module (e.g., client.py)
o Parse Arguments: --host <server_ip> and --port <port_number>
if desired.
o Establish Connection: Create a socket and connect() to the server.
o User Registration: Prompt for username and send server:register
<username>.
o Listener Thread: Continuously reads from the socket and prints any
incoming messages to the console.
o Main Loop: Reads user input. Depending on the format
(<recipient>:<message>, server:who, server:exit), sends the
appropriate command to the server.
5. Usage Instructions
1. Start the Server
python server.py --port 8080
o The server will begin listening on localhost:8080.
2. Start a Client
python client.py --host server_ip --port 8080
o When prompted, enter a username, e.g., Alice.
o If the username is accepted, you can begin sending messages.
3. Sending a Message
o In the client console, type <recipient>:<message>, e.g.:
Bob:Hello Bob!
o Bob’s client will immediately display Alice: Hello Bob!.
4. Checking Who’s Online
o Enter server:who in the client console.
o The server responds with a list of currently online users.
5. Exiting
o Type server:exit.
o The client notifies the server that you are disconnecting, then closes.
6. Possible Extensions (Optional)
• Offline Messaging / Message Queues
o Store messages for users who are offline and deliver them once they
reconnect.
• Encryption
o Integrate TLS/SSL or other encryption libraries to secure messages in transit.
• Private Group Chat or Chat Rooms
o Extend the server logic to handle group chat sessions with multiple
recipients.
• User Authentication
o Require a password for username registration to enhance security.
• Graphical User Interface (GUI)
o Replace or supplement the command-line interface with a simple GUI using
libraries like tkinter.
3. Submission Requirements
• Source Code:
Submit all source files along with any scripts needed to set up the virtual
environment.
• Documentation:
Include a README file with instructions on how to run your project and a brief
report describing your design and implementation decisions.
• Testing Evidence:
Provide evidence (screenshots or video recording) showing that your chat system
works as expected in the virtual environment.
4. Evaluation
Performance Levels:
• Excellent (90-100% of points)
o Fully meets requirements, shows strong understanding, robust and well-tested
implementation, code is very clean and well-documented.
• Good (80-89%)
o Meets most requirements with minor issues or omissions, code is mostly
clean, only a few bugs or documentation gaps.
• Needs Improvement (70-79%)
o Partially meets requirements, some notable bugs or missing features, code is
somewhat disorganized or under-documented.
• Incomplete (<70%)
o Fails to meet a significant number of requirements, has major errors or is
non-functional in key areas, documentation is insufficient.
